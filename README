# 🪨 Iberpiedra Buscador

**Iberpiedra Buscador** is a full-stack web application developed for internal use in a family-owned company.  
It allows users to **search, add, update, and delete stone products** through a simple web interface connected to a REST API.

This project was built as a **real-world portfolio project**, representing my **first complete application developed independently**, covering frontend, backend, database design, deployment, and production configuration.
