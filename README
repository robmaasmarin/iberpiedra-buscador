# 🪨 Iberpiedra Buscador

Iberpiedra Buscador is a full-stack web application developed for internal use in a family-owned company.  
The application allows managing a stone products catalog through a web interface, providing full CRUD functionality.

This project is part of my personal portfolio and represents my **first complete independently developed application**, covering frontend development, backend API design, database integration, deployment, and production configuration.

→ REST API (Spring Boot)  
→ PostgreSQL Database

The frontend is fully decoupled and communicates with the backend via HTTP requests.

## 🔐 Security

This application does not implement authentication or authorization.
It is intended for internal company use, with access controlled externally.

## 🚀 What I Learned

Building a complete CRUD application from scratch

Developing REST APIs with Spring Boot

Working with Spring Data JPA and relational databases

Migrating from MySQL to PostgreSQL for production

Configuring CORS for frontend–backend communication

Deploying backend services and databases on Render

Deploying a static frontend on GitHub Pages

Structuring and delivering a real-world full-stack project independently

This was my first fully independent project involving frontend, backend, database, and deployment.

## 🔮 Possible Improvements

- Authentication and role-based access control

- Input validation and improved error handling

- Pagination and advanced search

- Product category management

- API documentation with Swagger / OpenAPI

- Unit and integration testing

- UI/UX refinements
